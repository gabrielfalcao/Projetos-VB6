DiscWizard has not detected an ATA drive on your system.  Several 
reasons can cause DiscWizard to make this conclusion.
No ATA drives, continue with this procedure at the next step.
A device driver hooking Interrupt 13 and not reporting back ATA
information.  If the device driver (i.e. disk cache) is loaded 
under windows, uninstall it.  If a message is displayed while 
running DiscWizard stating, Dynamic Drive Overlay DDO
will be loaded DO NOT reinstall the removed device driver.  

If you have a SCSI hard drive as your boot drive, DiscWizard cannot
be used to install the new ATA drive. You must follow the procedure
outlined below: (For Windows 3.1x only, this procedure cannot be
used for Windows 95. For Windows 95 users, please see the section
"For Windows 95 Users".)

NOTE: Once you add an ATA hard drive to your system, the SCSI drive
will no longer be the boot device. Therefore, you will need to copy
all the files from your SCSI drive to the new ATA drive to be able
to boot and run your system.

- Create a DOS system bootable diskette. (Place blank diskette
  in your A: drive and type "format a: /s" from the C: prompt, or 
  "sys a:" if the diskette is formatted but has no files on it.)

- From the DOS C: prompt, type "cd\discwzrd" and [ENTER]. If you
  chose a different name for the DiscWizard directory, type the
  appropriate directory name.

- Type "copy filecopy.exe a:" to copy the file to the diskette you
  just created.

- Install the new ATA hard drive with jumpers set for a single drive. 
  See the jumper information listed on the Seagate hard drive. 

- Re-boot the system with the boot diskette you just created in the
  A: drive.

- Insert the DiscWizard diskette in your A: drive, (or B:, as needed)
  and run Disk Manager by typing "dm" at the A: (or B:) prompt. 

- Select "Easy" or "Advanced Install" as you wish.

- Once the Disk Manager program has installed the new hard drive,
  you will need to copy the files from your existing SCSI drive to
  the new ATA drive.

- Insert the boot diskette you created into the A: drive.

- Type "filecopy".

- When asked for the source drive, press "D" and [ENTER].

- When asked for the destination drive, Press "C" and [ENTER].

- Press [ENTER] to begin copying all the files to the new drive.

- Once the filecopy has completed successfully, remove the diskette
  from the A: drive and re-boot the system. 

- At this point the installation is complete, and the system will 
  boot normally from the new Seagate ATA hard drive. 

*FOR WINDOWS 95 USERS*

Due to the fact that most BIOSes will assign drive numbers to 
ATA hard drives before SCSI hard drives the following scenario
may occur:

- A SCSI drive is in the system as the "boot drive".

- An ATA drive is added to the system.

- The BIOS now makes the ATA drive the "boot drive".

- Booting from the SCSI drive is now not an option.

Trying to copy files from the SCSI drive to the new ATA drive from
DOS should not be attempted because DOS does not understand long
file names.

The following solutions are the only options that will take care of
this problem:

1) Intelligent ATA host adapter with on board BIOS that does not
use a CMOS drive type can set the ROM memory address
higher than the SCSI adapter address.
2) System BIOS that has a multi-boot option or the ability
to set the boot order may be able to keep the SCSI drive as the
boot drive.

Either of these options allow the user to boot to their current
operating system on the SCSI drive. This will allow the user
to use "FDISK" and "FORMAT" to install their new ATA drive.
