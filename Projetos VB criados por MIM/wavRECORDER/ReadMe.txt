'Description:   This is for programmers who wants to learn how
		to use waveIn API's for recording and how to use 
		mmioXXXX API's to save the recorded WAV into a 
		file. It also exhibits the use of CALLBACK_WINDOW
		procedure.

		Start the application so that the recording can
		be started as soon as the source is ready.
		Just play any music, say from a CD source,
		Microphone, Line In. Make sure that the line is
		not muted, and the input device (Wave In) is 
		selected. This can be done with the help of 
		Volume Control which comes with 98/NT 4.0. 

		The rest is easy.
