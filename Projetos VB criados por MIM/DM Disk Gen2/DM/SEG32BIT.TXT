Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

     1. What is a Windows driver?
        A Windows driver is a "translation program" that helps
        Microsoft Windows and Windows-for-Workgroups communicate with
        devices attached to your computer. Such devices may include
        modems, CD-ROMs, video cards, and hard drives.

     2. What is the Windows 32-bit disk access driver?
        This is a driver that allows Windows to communicate with your
        hard disc directly (in protected mode) rather than going
        through DOS or through your system BIOS. This means that your
        CPU remains in 32-bit mode (if it supports this mode) rather
        than slowing to 16-bit mode.

        The 32-bit drive access driver that Microsoft created for
        Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is named *WDCTRL.
        Unfortunately, this driver does not work with hard drives
        larger than 528 Mbytes.

     3. What is SEG32BIT.386?
        SEG32BIT is Seagate's version of a Windows driver that
        replaces the generic driver, *WDCTRL. It is designed
        specifically to work with ATA (IDE) drives larger than 528
        Mbytes up to 8.4GB. It also configures your computer to take
        advantage of any high-speed or LBA data transfer modes
        supported by your computer and your hard drive(s).

     4. Why should I use SEG32BIT.386?
        The Microsoft 32-bit disc access driver does not work with ATA
        (IDE) hard drives larger than 528 Mbytes. The Seagate driver
        does. SEG32BIT also supports advanced disc access features
        that may significantly improve the performance of your drive.
        These features are not supported by the Microsoft 32-bit
        driver.

        Note. If your computer and drive host adapter do not support
              32-bit addressing or advanced data transfer modes, you
              do not need to use this driver.

     5. Does SEG32BIT work with any hard drive?
        As long as your computer contains at least one Seagate ATA
        (IDE) hard drive, SEG32BIT can be used for 32-bit disc access
        with any ATA (IDE) hard drive attached to that computer.

     6. How much will my disc performance improve if I use SEG32BIT?
        Once installed, SEG32BIT optimizes the data transfers to and
        from your drive, if your system and drive support high-speed
        data access features. The increase in performance will vary
        depending on many factors, including the system architecture,
        bus speed, interface chip manufacturer and version level.

======================================================================

Features of the SEG32BIT driver
-------------------------------
     *  Supports 32-bit drive access - Speeds up data access by
        allowing the computer to choose the most efficient disc access
        method.

     *  Supports drives larger than 528 Mbytes up to 8.4GB.

     *  Supports Read/Write Multiple - Speeds up data access by
        allowing the drive and computer to send more than one sector
        of data for each system interrupt. This feature is drive-
        dependent and will be automatically detected by the driver if
        it is available. It is only supported by computers with '386
        and later CPU chips.

     *  Supports PIO Modes 3 and 4 - Speeds up data transfers by
        minimizing the amount of time between blocks of data
        transferred to or from the drive.

        Note. PIO Modes 3 and 4 can only be implemented if they are
              supported by the drives, the drive controller, and the
              host computer. In addition, the host computer must have
              a PCI bus or VL (Local bus) architecture.

     *  When Windows or Windows for Workgroups is loaded, SEG32BIT
        automatically determines which features can be implemented.
        SEG32BIT lists those features on the screen when Windows is
        booted up.

======================================================================

SEG32BIT compatibility issues
-----------------------------
     1. Compatible system software:
        Microsoft Windows version 3.1
        Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11

     2. Compatible bus types:
        ISA, EISA, VL and PCI bus architectures.

     3. Compatible hard drives:
        SEG32BIT is compatible with most ATA (IDE) hard drives, but
        can only be installed if a Seagate drive has been attached to
        and recognized by the host computer.

     4. Possible driver conflicts:
        CD-ROM Drives - You cannot attach a CD-ROM drive to the same
        ATA cable as your hard drive if you are using the SEG32BIT
        driver and have the 32 bit drive access option enabled (The
        CD-ROM is usable if the 32 bit drive access option is
        disabled).

     5. Third-party disc access Drivers:
        Disk-access drivers provided by some vendors of ATA Host
        Adapters cannot be used in conjunction with SEG32BIT. These
        drivers may conflict with or disable SEG32BIT, resulting in
        lower system performance. Only one 32-bit disc-access driver
        may be run within a Windows session.

     6. Drive Controller Interface Chips Supported:
        ADI/2 & 3  - VESA bus
        CMD 640B - PCI & VESA buses
        DTC 803 - VESA bus

     7. I/O Port supported:
        The SEG32BIT driver only supports hard drives attached to the
        primary port address (1F0 hex)

======================================================================

Installing the SEG32BIT Driver
------------------------------
      SEG32BIT may be installed using three possible methods:

      - using DiscWizard v2.4 or Disk Manager v9.44s+ select  Advanced 
        option menu then Maintenance
      - using STSETUP.EXE (see below)
      - manually by editing the Windows 3.1x SYSTEM.INI file (see
        below)

   If the file STSETUP.EXE exists on the floppy or in the download file,
   use it for a quick and easy installation.

   Install the SEG32BIT.386 driver as follows:

      1. Start Windows.

      2. From the Program Manager menu, select File.

      3. Select Run.

      4. Insert the Seagate software diskette into the diskette
         drive (assumed to be drive A).

      5. In the command line box, type  a:\stsetup.

      6. Read the license agreement that appears on the screen. If you
         agree to the terms, select ACCEPT AGREEMENT to continue.

      7. The next screen lists the features the SEG32BIT.386 driver
         supports. If your computer supports these features,
         SEG32BIT.386 will enable them in 32-bit disc access mode for
         all drives that support them. Select Install Driver to
         continue.

      8. After the driver is installed, the program automatically
         re-enables 32-bit disc access in the Windows control panel.
         Alternatively, you can do this manually, after exiting the
         stsetup program.

   To manually install the SEG32BIT 32-bit disk access file:

      1. Open the SYSTEM.INI file with a standard text editor such as
         NotePad or DOS Edit.

      2. Go to the section [386Enh] and place a semicolon (;) in front
         of the line "device=*wdctrl" which is Windows' default 32-bit
         disk access driver.

      3. Add a new line below (without quotes) the original driver as
         "device=seg32bit.386; Seagate 32 bit disk access driver"

      4. Save the file and restart Windows.  Windows will only allow
         one disk access driver to be installed.  A startup error
         message will be displayed if there is another third party
         driver installed.  Other third drivers may include the
         following: mh32bit.386, wdcdrv.386, pti13.386, ptictrl.386,
         eide2300.386, cpqint13.386, cpqwtl.386, flexidrv.386,
         optivic.386, wdctrl32.386, cmdint13.386, cmd640x.386.,
         adi2w102.386, wineide.386, shdrv.386, ide_win.386, sgat.386,
         ontrackw.386.  If any of these drivers are present, contact
         their respective vendors for additional instructions that may
         be pertinent to your system configuration.

     5.  Start the Windows Control Panel and select the 386 Enhanced
         icon.

     6.  Select Virual Memory and then Change>>.

     7.  Check the selection box at the bottom of the panel "Use 32 Bit
         Disk Access"

     8.  Restart Windows by following the system message instructions.
